## **Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on our Services are served by third-parties, including advertisers, other users of our Services, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see **Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information**.

## **How We Use Your Information**

We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:

- To present our Services and their contents to you.
- To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.

- To provide you with notices about your account, including expiration, renewal, or billing notices, or to make payments to you via blockchain technologies.

  - In regards to emails, we request metadata access for \<Reply-To\>, \<sender\>, \<recipient\> and \<x-fyncom-campaign-id\> headers. This helps us determine whether FynCom rewards should be distributed to an email address and/or filter emails accordingly. Services such as Sendgrid, Google Cloud and AWS are used for this.
  - In cases where we do not have direct access to an email inbox, we may request email forwarding to a FynCom email address, so we can access the metadata.
  - In cases where we have permissions to access the email inbox, such as for FynCom Filters: Email Edition, we may request the following permissions to create labels and send automated notification emails (as you) in response to senders whom you do not trust and/or have not left a FynCom Deposit for you. <br>
      <https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels> <br> 
      <https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic> <br>

- For any other purpose with your consent.

We may also use your information to contact you about our own and third-parties' goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please email us at support@fyncom.com. For more information, see **Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information**.

## **Disclosure of Your Information**

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual and cannot be directly or indirectly linked with personal information, without restriction.

We may disclose personal information that we collect or that you provide as described in this privacy policy:

- To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business.
- To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Services users or other individuals is among the assets transferred.

We utilize the services of third-party payment processors to conduct our Services. We do not collect or store certain aspects of your payment information (such as full credit card numbers or CVV numbers) and such information is transmitted directly to those third-party processors when you provide it. Information provided to such third-party payment processors may be subject to their own privacy policies.

## **Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

- **Tracking Technologies and Advertising.** You can set your browser or device to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
- **Promotional Offers from the Company.** If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to support@fyncom.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may unsubscribe following the unsubscribe link at the bottom or by sending us an email asking to be omitted from future email distributions. This opt out does not apply to information provided to the Company as a result of a product purchase, product service experience, or transactions involving our Services.

We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (" **NAI**") on the NAI's website.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information**

You can review and change your personal information and certain other information about or relating to you by logging into our Services and visiting your account profile page.

## **Data Security**

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions, account authentication and credentialing, and personal information you enter related to your account will be encrypted using SSL technology.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Services.

## **Privacy & The Blockchain:**

A key feature of many blockchain technologies is the transparency and public accessibility of on-chain transactions. This includes, without limitation, your public account address (" **public key**") and certain associated information. Some of our Services allow users to send crypto-assets from our Services to their own public keys, which we may collect to conduct such transactions. Information stored on-chain (including without limitation that generated when using the Services) may be public, immutable, and, in many cases, cannot be deleted or amended. Your public addresses may reveal information about you and this information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. If you are unfamiliar with blockchain technology and its transparent and public nature, we strongly encourage you to study how information is stored on blockchain technology before electing to use our Services that interact with public blockchains.

## **Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on applicable interfaces or pages of our Services. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by email to the primary email address specified in your account. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address and contact information for you, and for periodically visiting our Services and this privacy policy to check for any changes.
