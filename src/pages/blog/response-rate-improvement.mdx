# Mining for Response vs. Mining for Bitcoin

You've heard of "Mining Bitcoin", but have you heard of "Mining Responses" or "Mining Attention"?

I guarantee you've experienced it! All those unknown phone calls, unwanted texts, emails, DMs on social media / chat applications are the symptom of people trying to mine your attention. So who's making the money here and why isn't it you?

## **Why is this an issue?**

1. More businesses are created everyday. Those businesses want your feedback so they can grow and beat the incumbent players in their space.
2. Technological tools/services are making it 10x easier for businesses to automate sequences of emails, calls, texts, DMs, etc. to their "prospects". These sequences can have anywhere from 6 to 20 actions associated with them.

The exponential rise in our technology and similar rise in population of people/businesses make it incredibly difficult for even the best national institutions to get the responses they used to get.

## **Why should I care?**

You know that thing about scarcity and value? Well, if responses are becoming scarce, shouldn't we be able to value them? Isn't there an opportunity here, where ## **you can choose to monetize your responses or price your attention so highly** that not even the biggest spenders have a chance at contacting you?

In this world, how do you let "legitimate" messages from friends/family/businesses reach you without paying?

**FynCom was built to answer these questions. Our system does not require Bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining. Instead, we support "Response Mining"** where people get instantly rewarded for responding to emails, texts, calls, surveys and more - while businesses get the engagement they want. Are you ready for the Response Economy?
