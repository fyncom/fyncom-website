## Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

Any controversy or claim arising out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to these Terms of Use, with the exception of those controversies or claims specifically excluded in the following paragraph, shall be settled by a single arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in connection with AAA rules. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Use, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held within a fifty mile radius of Orange County, CA.

The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879.

You and the Company agree that the following types of disputes are not subject to this binding arbitration provision: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect or concerning the validity of either any of your or our intellectual property rights; (2) any claim for injunctive relief; and (3) any type of dispute that is not eligible for arbitration based upon the applicable law of California as governs these Terms of Service. All such disputes must be brought before a court of appropriate jurisdiction over Orange County, California.

In addition, you and the Company agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in the individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive the right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: support@fyncom.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.

The Company will provide 30-days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day after provision of the notice and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction).

For any dispute not subject to arbitration or where no election to arbitrate has been made, arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or the Website, shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in the City and County of Orange County, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

## Limitation on Time to File Claims

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

## Waiver and Severability

No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

## Entire Agreement

The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, our Dashboard Services Agreement (if applicable to you), and any other documents or policies explicitly incorporated herein, constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and RoboCash Inc. regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website.
